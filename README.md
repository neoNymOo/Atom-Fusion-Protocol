## <u>**Atom: Fusion Protocol**</u>
This is my mod that adds nuclear-powered power armor and the ability to upgrade it.

### **Build Guide:**
1. Click `use this template` at the top.
2. Clone the repository that you have created with this template to your local machine.
3. Make sure IDEA is using Java 21 for Gradle before you sync the project. Verify this by going to IDEA's `Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JVM`.
4. Open the project folder in IDEA. When prompted, click "Load Gradle Project" as it detects the `build.gradle`, if you weren't prompted, right-click the project's `build.gradle` in IDEA, select `Link Gradle Project`, after completion, hit `Refresh All` in the gradle tab on the right.
5. Run gradle tasks such as `runClient` and `runServer` in the IDEA gradle tab, or use the auto-imported run configurations like `1. Run Client`.

### **Credits:**
I would like to express my deep gratitude to everyone whose work inspired and supported the development of this mod:
1. **[Fallout Inspired Power Armor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fallout-inspired-power-amor):**\
   Adopted all Power Armor 3D models and select sound effects. Primary inspiration for this project.
2. **[Hbm's Nuclear Tech - Extended Edition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-extended-edition):**\
   Utilized certain resources and code elements. Their codebase served as invaluable learning material during development.
3. **[niiwork studio](https://niiwork.com/):**\
   Created the 3D model and animations for the docking station.

Without your effort and contribution, this mod would never have come to life. Thank you!
